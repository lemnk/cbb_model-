## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Dependencies**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```

### **Key Methods**
- **`transform()`**: Main feature computation method for each engineer
- **`build_features()`**: Orchestrates entire pipeline
- **`_merge_features()`**: Combines all feature sets
- **`_finalize_feature_set()`**: Cleans and prepares final dataset

### **Data Handling**
- **Database Integration**: Loads from Phase 1 PostgreSQL tables
- **Fallback Data**: Generates sample data when DB unavailable
- **Missing Value Handling**: Median for numeric, mode for categorical
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Removes duplicate columns and rows

## 📈 Feature Generation Process

### **Step 1: Data Loading**
- Load games data from `games` table
- Load odds data from `odds` table
- Fallback to sample data generation if DB unavailable

### **Step 2: Feature Engineering**
- Apply `TeamFeatures.transform()` to games data
- Apply `PlayerFeatures.transform()` to games data  
- Apply `MarketFeatures.transform()` to odds data
- Apply `DynamicFeatures.transform()` to games data

### **Step 3: Feature Merging**
- Start with base games DataFrame
- Merge team features by index
- Merge player features by index
- Merge dynamic features by index
- Merge market features by `game_id`

### **Step 4: Finalization**
- Remove duplicate columns
- Fill missing values appropriately
- Add metadata (generation date, version)
- Sort by date and game_id

### **Step 5: Output**
- Save to `data/features_YYYYMMDD.csv`
- Print comprehensive summary
- Return feature DataFrame

## 🎲 Mathematical Formulas

### **Momentum Index**
```
M_t = α × Δscore_t + β × Δpossessions_t
```
Where α = 0.7 (score weight), β = 0.3 (possession weight)

### **Line Movement**
```
ΔL = L_close - L_open
```

### **Implied Probability (Moneyline)**
```
P = 100 / (ML + 100)  if ML > 0
P = |ML| / (|ML| + 100)  if ML < 0
```

### **CLV Calculation**
```
CLV = P_open - P_close
```

### **Rest Advantage**
```
Rest_Advantage = Home_Days_Rest - Away_Days_Rest
```

### **Altitude Adjustment**
```
Adjustment = (Altitude - 4000) / 1000  if Altitude > 4000ft
Adjustment = 0  otherwise
```

# Phase 2: Feature Engineering - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 2 implements a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline for the CBB Betting ML System. The system transforms raw game data, player statistics, odds information, and situational factors into model-ready feature sets that capture the complex dynamics of college basketball games.

## Architecture

### Modular Design
The feature engineering system is built with a modular, class-based architecture:

```
src/features/
├── __init__.py              # Package initialization
├── team_features.py         # Team-level efficiency and performance metrics
├── player_features.py       # Player availability and impact metrics
├── dynamic_features.py      # Situational and contextual features
├── market_features.py       # Betting market and odds analysis
├── feature_utils.py         # Utility functions for feature processing
└── feature_pipeline.py      # Orchestration and pipeline management
```

### Feature Categories

#### 1. Team Features (`TeamFeatures`)
**Purpose**: Capture team-level performance characteristics and efficiency metrics.

**Key Features**:
- **Offensive Efficiency**: Points per possession, shooting percentages
- **Defensive Efficiency**: Points allowed per possession, defensive ratings
- **Pace**: Possessions per game, tempo indicators
- **Home/Away Splits**: Win percentages, scoring differentials
- **Consistency Metrics**: Rolling averages (3, 5, 10 games) of scoring and defense
- **Win/Loss Streaks**: Current streak lengths and momentum indicators

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Offensive Efficiency = Points Scored / Possessions
Defensive Efficiency = Points Allowed / Possessions
Pace = Total Possessions / Game Duration
```

#### 2. Player Features (`PlayerFeatures`)
**Purpose**: Assess player availability and its impact on team performance.

**Key Features**:
- **Injury Flags**: Binary indicators for player availability
- **Foul Trouble**: Foul rate, projected minutes lost due to fouls
- **Bench Contribution**: Percentage of points from bench players
- **Bench Depth**: Number of available bench players
- **Minutes Distribution**: Player rotation patterns

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Foul Rate = Fouls / Minutes Played
Projected Minutes Lost = Fouls × (Average Minutes per Foul)
Bench Contribution % = Bench Points / Total Team Points
```

#### 3. Dynamic Features (`DynamicFeatures`)
**Purpose**: Capture situational and contextual factors that affect game outcomes.

**Key Features**:
- **Streak Analysis**: Win/loss streak lengths and momentum
- **Rest Days**: Days since last game, fatigue indicators
- **Travel Factors**: Distance traveled, time zone changes
- **Altitude Adjustments**: Venue elevation impact on performance

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Streak Momentum = Win Streak - Loss Streak
Fatigue Index = exp(-Rest Days / 3)
Travel Fatigue = exp(-1000 / Distance) if Distance > 1000 miles
Altitude Impact = (Altitude - 3000) / 1000 if Altitude > 3000ft
```

#### 4. Market Features (`MarketFeatures`)
**Purpose**: Analyze betting market dynamics and identify value opportunities.

**Key Features**:
- **Line Movement**: Opening vs. closing spread and total changes
- **Implied Probabilities**: Converted from moneyline odds
- **Market Efficiency**: Line stability and movement patterns
- **Closing Line Value (CLV)**: Model predictions vs. market closes

**Mathematical Foundation**:
```
Line Movement = Close Line - Open Line
Implied Probability = 100 / (Moneyline + 100) for positive odds
Market Efficiency Score = Σ(Movement Magnitudes)
CLV = Model Prediction - Market Close
```

### Game Strength Index (GSI)

The system computes a composite Game Strength Index using weighted components:

```
GSI = 0.35 × normalize(team_efficiency) + 
      0.25 × normalize(player_availability) + 
      0.20 × normalize(dynamic_factors) + 
      0.20 × normalize(market_signals)
```

**Weighting Rationale**:
- **Team Efficiency (35%)**: Most predictive of game outcomes
- **Player Availability (25%)**: Critical for team performance
- **Dynamic Factors (20%)**: Situational context importance
- **Market Signals (20%)**: Market sentiment and efficiency

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: Raw game data, player stats, odds data
2. **Processing**: Each feature module applies transformations
3. **Merging**: Features combined by `game_id` with proper aggregation
4. **Output**: Unified feature set with GSI calculation

### Feature Engineering Pipeline
```python
# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = FeaturePipeline()

# Build complete feature set
features = pipeline.build_features()

# Save to CSV with timestamp
output_file = pipeline.save_features(features)

# Generate summary report
pipeline.print_summary(features)
```

### Data Quality Features
- **Missing Value Handling**: Zero-filling strategy for numeric features
- **Outlier Detection**: IQR and z-score based outlier identification
- **Feature Validation**: Correlation analysis and feature importance ranking
- **Data Consistency**: Proper merging and aggregation by game_id

market_features = [col for col in features.columns if 'market_' in col]
```

### Custom Data Input
```python
# Use custom data instead of sample data
custom_games = pd.DataFrame(...)
custom_odds = pd.DataFrame(...)
custom_players = pd.DataFrame(...)

features = pipeline.build_features(
    games_df=custom_games,
    odds_df=custom_odds,
    players_df=custom_players
)
```

### Feature Analysis
```python
# Analyze feature correlations
from src.features.feature_utils import feature_correlation_analysis

correlation_results = feature_correlation_analysis(
    features, 
    target_col='game_strength_index'
)

# Handle missing values
from src.features.feature_utils import handle_missing
clean_features = handle_missing(features, strategy="zero")

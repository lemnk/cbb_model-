## 🏗️ CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### **Pipeline Overview**
The CI/CD pipeline consists of 4 main jobs that run in sequence:

1. **Lint Job** → Code style enforcement
2. **Test Job** → Multi-Python version testing with coverage
3. **Monitoring Job** → Monitoring system validation
4. **Build & Deploy Job** → Docker build and deployment (main branch only)

### **Workflow Triggers**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
```

- **Push to main**: Triggers full pipeline including deployment
- **Pull Request**: Triggers validation jobs (lint, test, monitoring)
- **Deployment**: Only runs on main branch after all checks pass

## 🔧 Job Details

### **Job 1: Lint**
**Purpose**: Enforce code quality and style standards

**Steps**:
1. **Checkout code** → Clone repository
2. **Set up Python 3.10** → Install Python environment
3. **Install linting tools** → flake8 and black
4. **Run flake8** → Style and complexity checks
5. **Run black check** → Code formatting validation

**Configuration**:
```yaml
flake8 src/ tests/ --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503
black --check src/ tests/
```

**Failure Conditions**:
- Code style violations (flake8)
- Incorrect formatting (black)
- Complexity issues or unused imports

### **Job 2: Test**
**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing across multiple Python versions

**Strategy**: Matrix testing with Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11

**Steps**:
1. **Checkout code** → Clone repository
2. **Set up Python** → Matrix version selection
3. **Install dependencies** → requirements.txt
4. **Install testing tools** → pytest, pytest-cov
5. **Run tests with coverage** → Full test suite execution
6. **Upload coverage** → Codecov integration

**Test Configuration**:
```yaml
pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Coverage Integration**:
- **XML Report**: For CI/CD integration
- **Terminal Report**: Human-readable coverage summary
- **Codecov Upload**: External coverage tracking

### **Job 3: Monitoring Validation**
**Purpose**: Validate monitoring system functionality

**Steps**:
1. **Checkout code** → Clone repository
2. **Set up Python 3.10** → Install Python environment
3. **Install dependencies** → requirements.txt
4. **Install testing tools** → pytest
5. **Run individual tests** → Each monitoring module separately
6. **Run all tests together** → Integration testing

**Test Execution**:
```yaml
- pytest tests/test_schema_validation.py -v
- pytest tests/test_drift_detection.py -v
- pytest tests/test_performance_monitor.py -v
- pytest tests/test_alerts.py -v
- pytest tests/test_*.py --tb=short -v
```

**Validation Scope**:
- **Schema Validation**: Data structure and type checking
- **Drift Detection**: Statistical change detection
- **Performance Monitoring**: ML metrics and profitability
- **Alert System**: Multi-channel notification delivery

### **Job 4: Build & Deploy**
**Purpose**: Containerization and deployment automation

**Conditions**: Only runs on main branch after all previous jobs succeed

**Steps**:
1. **Checkout code** → Clone repository
2. **Set up Docker Buildx** → Multi-platform builds
3. **Login to GHCR** → GitHub Container Registry authentication
4. **Build Docker images** → Latest and commit-specific tags
5. **Push images** → Upload to container registry
6. **Deploy to staging** → Environment deployment (placeholder)
7. **Notify results** → Success/failure notifications

**Docker Configuration**:
```yaml
docker build -t ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:latest .
docker build -t ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}:${{ github.sha }} .
```

**Deployment Features**:
- **Version Tagging**: Latest + commit-specific tags

    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Lint Job Failures**
```bash
# Fix flake8 issues
pip install flake8
flake8 src/ --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503

# Fix black formatting
pip install black
black src/ tests/
```

### **Test Job Failures**
```bash
# Run tests locally
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v

# Check specific test file
pytest tests/test_schema_validation.py -v -s
```

### **Monitoring Validation Failures**
```bash
# Test individual components
python -c "from src.monitoring import SchemaValidator; print('Schema validation OK')"
python -c "from src.monitoring import DriftDetector; print('Drift detection OK')"
python -c "from src.monitoring import PerformanceMonitor; print('Performance monitoring OK')"
python -c "from src.monitoring import AlertManager; print('Alerts system OK')"
```

### **Build & Deploy Failures**
```bash
# Test Docker build locally
docker build -t cbb-ml:test .

# Check Dockerfile syntax
docker build --no-cache -t cbb-ml:test .

# Verify image contents
docker run --rm cbb-ml:test python -c "print('Docker image OK')"
```
